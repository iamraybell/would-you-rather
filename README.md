## Would You Rather App
# Project Purpose:
This Website was built as a project for Udacity's React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of how Redux works in a React-based web app.

# Installed Needs:
- Node.js 
- Create-React-App.
- A Browser (I prefer Chrome!)


# Start Up: 
- Run git clone 
- npm install
- npm start


A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If not, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser window.
Happy trails!
